# Heart-Attack-Prediction
This is a Heart Disease Prediction project. In which the user enters the details like gender, age, cholesterol, chest pain, etc. Then the machine learning algorithms predict whether a person can able to be attacked or not by a heart attack.

This is a Heart Attack Prediction project. 
It is a Classification type model. 
In which the user enters the details like gender, age, cholesterol, chest pain, etc. 
Then the machine learning algorithms predict the eligibility of the chances of attack. 
Here we use the Random Forest algorithm and Flask for the deployment and CSS for the front end.

Algorithm used : Random Forest

Front end : Bootstrap, CSS, HTML

Machine Learning project based on Classification Model.
